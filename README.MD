Create a contacts app in a language of choice.

Using this app, you should be able to:
add a contact
edit a contact
delete a contact
list contacts
The contact should have the following fields:
first name
last name 
telephone number
If you manage to do the above, you can try and make it so that you can add more than one telephone number per contact.

The contact data can be stored in ram, so no need for persistence unless you wish/can/have time to make it so.
